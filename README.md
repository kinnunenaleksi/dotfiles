# dotfiles 

## Set-up 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kinnunenaleksi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow nvim etc..
```

## Dependencies 

- Neovim 0.10.4

## Progress 

- Fish doesn't work directly with Ubuntu
- Nvim doesn't start at all due to issues with the NvChad .local files 

## Going forward 

One idea is just to write instructions on how to install NvChad, and then the required LSPs as necessary.
